# Backstage Talks - magazine archive
A study to try and replicate the "Backstage Talks - Magazine archive" from Frontend Practice landing page, to learn scroll transitions, color choices, fixed content, minimal layout, and more! Will experiment building the layout and components with React/Next.js with a focus on CSS.
